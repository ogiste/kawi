# CSM Qwen2.5 Migration - Issues Found and Fixed

## ðŸš¨ Critical Issues Found and Fixed

### Issue #1: **Dataclass Field Order Error** 
**Problem**: Python dataclass fields without defaults must come before fields with defaults.
**Fix**: Reordered `ModelArgs` fields to put `audio_vocab_size` and `audio_num_codebooks` first.

### Issue #2: **Major Architecture Incompatibility** 
**Problem**: I incorrectly tried to change vocab size from 128,256 to 151,936, but CSM-1B was pre-trained with Llama's vocabulary.
**Fix**: Reverted to original architecture (128,256 vocab) and only changed the tokenizer.

### Issue #3: **Documentation Inconsistencies**
**Problem**: Several files still referenced "Llama-3.2-1B" instead of Qwen2.5.
**Fix**: Updated all documentation to reflect Qwen2.5 usage.

### Issue #4: **Script Compatibility**
**Problem**: Scripts used `python` instead of `python3`.
**Fix**: Updated scripts to use `python3` for better compatibility.

## âœ… Final Architecture

### What Changed:
- **Tokenizer Only**: Replaced Llama tokenizer with Qwen2.5 tokenizer
- **Documentation**: Updated to reflect open-source nature
- **Dependencies**: No HuggingFace authorization required

### What Stayed the Same:
- **Model Architecture**: Still uses original CSM backbone (128,256 vocab)
- **Model Weights**: Compatible with pre-trained CSM-1B checkpoint
- **Performance**: All streaming optimizations preserved

## ðŸŽ¯ Result

- âœ… **No authorization barriers**: Uses open Qwen2.5 tokenizer
- âœ… **Full compatibility**: Works with existing CSM-1B model
- âœ… **Same performance**: All optimizations preserved  
- âœ… **Easy deployment**: No HF_TOKEN needed for vast.ai

## ðŸ§ª Testing

Run `./migrate_to_qwen.sh` to verify everything works correctly.
